# r/place overlays

A [TampermonkeyÂ®](https://www.tampermonkey.net/ "Official TampermonkeyÂ® website") script for different [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/ "Official r/place subreddit") overlays.

## What

This script provides a [list of overlays](#list-of-overlays "scroll to the list of default overlays") that are overlayed over the r/place canvas.

Dots means the overlay is 3x larger, so it looks like tiny dots within each pixel (this is recommended), and full means 1:1 size of the canvas, so the overlay is covering up the pixels (useful for seeing how it would look like if every pixel is like in the overlay).

Additionally, one can take a screenshot of the current r/place canvas (this doesn't include the widget or any overlays).

Users can also add a temporary image that will also be overlayed over the canvas for convenience (position and size can be fine-tuned).

### List of overlays

The following overlays are there by default, but more can be added or removed by users choice.

_When using this userscript for the first time these are invisible (use the eye toggle next to the name and then click on "update overlays")._

## Other overlays

This userscript is mainly inspired by these overlays, especialy PlaceDE since I was part of the PlaceDE nightwatch <img height="16" alt="ðŸª‘" title="Stuhl" src="https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/64bef8155212029786921edb/4x.avif"><img height="20" alt="o7" title="o7" src="https://cdn.7tv.app/emote/643f7ce3d9dd1d39100f31eb/4x.avif"> in r/place 2023.
